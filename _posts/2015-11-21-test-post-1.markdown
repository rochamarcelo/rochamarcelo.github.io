	Every GitHub Page runs through Jekyll when you push content to a specially named branch within your repository. For User Pages, use the master branch in your username.github.io repository. For Project Pages, use the gh-pages branch in your project's repository. Because a normal HTML site is also a valid Jekyll site, you don't have to do anything special to keep your standard HTML files unchanged. Jekyll has thorough documentation that covers its features and usage. Simply start committing Jekyll formatted files and you'll be using Jekyll in no time.</p>
